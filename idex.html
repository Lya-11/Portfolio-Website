  <h2>background Information</h2>

  <p>I'm an international student studying at University of Pittsburgh. Studying abroad has always been my dream and I feel so grateful for this opportinity! I worked really hard in high school to achive my goal. Luckily, I was granted the most prestigious scholarship in my country!</p>
	<p>I took a gap year and studied in North Carolina State University. It was a unique experience where I got to meet a lot of cool people and make new friends. It was also an opportinity to do bad in university without worrying about grades. It was the perfect send off for our new adventure! </p>

<!--You don't need an image here if you don't want one!-->
</div>


<!--Between these divisions, you may want to add a new div element like an image (see the bottom of this html page for instructions) It's always worth thinking about how a user navigates your site. How do you want to break up the experience of scrolling down here? How might it feel on a laptop, phone, or tablet?-->

<!--Here's another div, same as before. Note the question about putting an image behind the text. You could give this section a different class with a different background--image or color.-->

  <h2>My Major</h2>

<!--img src="cats.png" alt="two orange cats on a shed roof-describe the image HERE for accessibility purposes" class="center-img" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;">
<!--This image sits above your description below, but could it be the background like the hero image? You might try and modify this <div> by giving it a new class that mirrors the "hero-image" above. You can take care of that in the CSS. -->

  <p>I study Computer Science. I chose my major because of my passion in coding. I was drawn to coding from movies and tv series and despite what many people say, coding gives the same vibes you see in movies! Another reason for choosing my major was my video games addiction. I love learning about the process behind making a video game and creating the illistrations and character's movements.</p>

<!--To change the image for this wide screen paralax scroll, you will need change the file name in your style.css to match an image in your project folder. Look for ".paral1ax" on your style.css sheet-->

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <h3>Drawing</h3>
  <p>Drawing has always been my hobby. I love the feelings I have whenever I start drawing. Picturing things in my own way, and delivering these pictures to people is a wonderful feeling. I started drawing when I was 7 years old and learned a lot from many sources. In middle school, I bought a drawing tablet and started learning digital painting. Even though it has been a while since I drew something cool, drawing is still my fun place to be creative.</p>
  <h3>Piano</h3>
  <p> I recently started to learn playing the piano and it's really fun! During quarantine my dad tought me how to play “Bella Ciao” and it was fairly easy and very enoyable. The music it richer when you hear it from an  instrument. I then started playing my favorite songs and perform them to my family. Learning piano created a special bond between me and my father and it became our common hobby.</p>
